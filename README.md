# Quaver Skinning Guide

A Github Repository that is dedicated to Quaver skinning tutorials, rules and guidelines, and many more.

If you want to help me out and contribute to the guide, please message me in my Discord: `Chirijiraden#4992`

**NOTE:** I do not get any messages from people who do not have a mutual Discord server with me. Should you send me a message, please join the [Official Quaver Discord Server here](https://discord.gg/quaver) or just be in one of the servers I'm in as well.

Also, this guide is incomplete until I say it is. Again, if you want to help me, there's my Discord tag up there. I will give credit and add your name in this repository if you help me, no matter how minor it is.

Go to the [wiki](https://github.com/chirijidev/QuaverSkinningGuide/wiki) straight away to get started.
