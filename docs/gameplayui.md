# Creating the Gameplay Elements

Creating gameplay elements is basically the highest priority when it comes to making a skin because this is where you'll probably have your longest time editing stuff in here not because making elements would be complicated, but because adjusting and editing your skin settings via the skin.ini file take a lot of time until you get what you really want.

This time, I will be making a very simple, minimal gameplay so you will get the basic idea of making skin elements. If you want to make something that's like eyecandy or more than just a simple one, then go ahead. Feel free to be creative and put your ideas in your skin elements.

Let's get started!

```
DISCLAIMER: I will be using Adobe Photoshop in all of my stuff here. But it should give you the idea on how to make these stuff as it's intended to be as simple as possible. No special effects. If you want to add something else in your elements, it's all up to you.

Also, this guide will be VERY, VERY LONG. So please make sure you're doing this at your free times.
