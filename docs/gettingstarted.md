# Getting Started

## What is skinning?

- Skinning is one of features in Quaver where you can customize the client interface, gameplay interface, and the sound effects of the game to your liking.

## Some other things you need to know, probably... (AKA FAQs)

### Is there an osu!mania skin to Quaver converter?

```
Yes, there is a converter available made by Adri.
```

- You can download it here: https://rhythmgamers.net/QBC/

- Tutorial on how to convert mania skins to Quaver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWeLbx48NVI

- Changelogs: https://gitlab.com/Adri-/quaverskinconverter#changelog

> Note: The converted skin may not have the exact same gameplay in Quaver as it is in osu!mania. You will have to configure the elements and the skin.ini after converting.

### Is there a default skin template to begin with?

```
Yes. The new default skins can be found in Janko's Steam Workshop.
```

- Link to Janko's Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/id/janko5/myworkshopfiles/?appid=980610

    - In order to get the skins, you must subscribe to them. After subscribing, Steam will download the skin and they can be found in the workshop folder.
      - Quaver Steam Workshop Folder Location: `/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/980610`
      - New Default Skin Steam ID Numbers:
        - Arrow: `2163713057`
        - Bar: `2162713645`
        - Circle: `2163546266`
      - Note: This is also where you can find the rest of the skins you're currently subscribed on the Steam Workshop. The skin folders are named after their Steam item ID.

### VERY IMPORANT NOTE REGARDING EDITING SKINS THAT CAME FROM STEAM WORKSHOP

```
Before editing skins, please copy and paste them first to your local skin folder.
Then, you can start editing the files there.
The reason why you should make a copy of the skin is because Steam Workshop does not support local changes.
```

- Quaver Local Skin Folder Location: `/Steam/steamapps/common/Quaver/Skins`

```
However, if you want the old default/legacy skins, you can download it here below.
(Disclaimer: these old default files are outdated, but if you want to use it, be my guest.)
```

 - [Arrow Skin](https://github.com/chirijidev/QuaverSkinningGuide/raw/main/assets/Default_Arrow_Skin_New_Theme.qs)
 - [Bar Skin](https://github.com/chirijidev/QuaverSkinningGuide/raw/main/assets/Default_Bar_Skin_New_Theme.qs)
 - [Circle Skin](https://github.com/chirijidev/QuaverSkinningGuide/raw/main/assets/Default_Circle_Skin_New_Theme.qs)

After downloading one of the old default skins, you should drag the files in the game in order to load the skins. They will be located in your local Skin folder after the game refreshes when loading the imported skin.

### Is there a wiki or documentation regarding skinning stuffs?

> Yes. Here's the [link](https://wiki.quavergame.com/docs/skins). Everything in the wiki should be up to date. I will be explaining all of them as you read the guide along the way.
