# Getting Started

## What is skinning?

- Skinning is one of features in Quaver where you can customize the client interface, gameplay interface, and the sound effects of the game.

## Some FAQs

### Is there an osu!mania skin to Quaver converter?

> Yes, there is a converter available made by Adri.

- You can download it here: https://rhythmgamers.net/QBC/

- Tutorial on how to convert mania skins to Quaver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWeLbx48NVI

- Changelogs: https://gitlab.com/Adri-/quaverskinconverter#changelog

> Note: The converted skin may not have the exact same gameplay in Quaver as it is in osu!mania. You will have to configure the elements and the skin.ini after converting.

### Is there a default skin template to begin with?

> Yes. The new default skins can be found in Janko's Steam Workshop.

- Link to Janko's Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/id/janko5/myworkshopfiles/?appid=980610

    - In order to get the skins, you must subscribe to them. After subscribing, they can be found in the workshop folder.
      - Quaver Steam Workshop Folder Location: `/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/980610`
      - New Default Skin Steam ID Numbers:
        - Arrow: `2163713057`
        - Bar: `2162713645`
        - Circle: `2163546266`

    - You must copy these folders and paste them to your own Quaver Skin Folder in order to be able to edit because the workshop folder does not support updating local changes.
      - Quaver Skin Folder Location: `/Steam/steamapps/common/Quaver/Skins`
